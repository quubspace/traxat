* ast: Automated Satellite Tracker
ast is a program to enable control of the Quub tabletop satellite tracker,
powered by rotctld, and fully compatible with GPredict.

** Building
ast is guaranteed to build on the Raspberry Pi 4B+ and the Raspberry Pi 3B+. It
appears to build correctly on the M1 MacBook Pro as well, but all other
platforms aren't directly supported.

ast is written in Rust, so you will need to have a Rust installation in order to
compile it. ast is guaranteed to compile with Rust 1.59.0 (stable) or newer, but
older versions might work.

To build ast:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ git clone https://github.com/quubspace/automated-satellite-tracker
$ cd automated-satellite-tracker
$ cargo build --release
#+END_SRC

** Credits
Initial prototypes of ast were inspired by PiTator by @M0JEC on GitHub. Thank
you to everyone at Quub for your continued support as well.
